# ðŸ§¹ Clean Demo Changes Summary

## **âœ… COMPLETED CLEANUP**

### **1. Removed All Preset Demo Requests**
**Files Modified:**
- `src/data/mockData.ts` - Removed `DEMO_REQUEST` export
- `src/contexts/DemoContext.tsx` - Start with empty requests array `[]`

**Result:** Platform now starts with completely clean slate - no existing requests

### **2. Fixed Compilation Errors**
**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/shared/DemoResetPanel.tsx` - Removed all `DEMO_REQUEST` references
- `src/contexts/DemoContext.tsx` - Removed `DEMO_REQUEST` dependencies
- `src/data/mockData.ts` - Cleaned up unused imports

**Result:** No TypeScript compilation errors, application runs smoothly

### **3. Cleaned Demo Reset Panel**
**Changes:**
- Simplified to single "Clean Slate Demo" option
- Removed all preset scenarios with prefilled data
- Focuses on live demo workflow

**Result:** Demo reset only provides clean slate option for live presentations

### **4. Dynamic AI Suggestions**
**File Modified:** `src/components/management/RequestReview.tsx`

**Before:** Hardcoded AI suggestions always showing
```typescript
const aiSuggestedDocs = [
  { id: 'ccr-4-2', title: 'Section 4.2 - Exterior Color Schemes', confidence: 95 },
  // ... more hardcoded suggestions
];
```

**After:** Dynamic suggestions based on actual request content
```typescript
const aiSuggestedDocs = generateAISuggestions(request);
```

**New `generateAISuggestions` Function:**
- Analyzes request title, description, and type
- Only suggests relevant governing documents
- Provides appropriate confidence levels
- Shows realistic AI behavior

**Result:** AI suggestions only appear when relevant to actual submitted requests

### **5. Clean Form Data**
